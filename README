git-wiki
========

[git-wiki][] is a WikiWikiWeb implementation which uses [git](http://git.or.cz)
to keep pages' history and [Sinatra](http://sinatra.rubyforge.org) to serve them.

Features
--------
My intend is to keep it as simple as possible and as small as one file.
I won't add any more feature unless I really need it. For example, I decided to not
support page history and diff and to use plain old `git diff` instead.
If you want such features, you should look at other people's [forks][], 
especially [al3x][]'s which has amongs other things history support and 
[schacon][]'s which has tarball and branching support.

License
-------
git-wiki is released under the WTFPL. See the included LICENSE file for details.
